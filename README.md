# Sales-Analysis-using-Python-Pandas
Hi , this is a data analysis project using python libraries like Pandas and matplotlib. I have analysed real world sales data set to answer key business questions and have shared meaningful insights.
I have used a sales analytics folder for my data set which includes 12 files refering to the sales data of all 12 months in a year. I have attached the same here.
I have performed the following tasks in this project-
1.Cleaned and prepared sales data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant entries, and converting data types using Pandas.
2.Conducted exploratory data analysis to address key business questions, identifying trends in sales performance, city-wise sales, and customer behavior.
3.Applied data aggregation, groupby analysis, and visualization using Matplotlib to uncover actionable insights.
4.Created visualizations like bar charts and line graphs to present findings effectively.

I have also attached a file with the name "procedure" for reference.
